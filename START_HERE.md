# Houston Astros Staff Software Engineer Technical Assessment

Thank you for your interest in the Staff Software Engineer position with the Astros R&D team! This technical assessment is designed to gauge your engineering approach, coding style, and understanding of modern development practices. Please **fork this repo** and submit your solutions and responses via a GitHub link.

## Deliverables

The technical assessment is composed of the following deliverables:

- **Project code:** Follow the README to set up your local environment and complete as many features as possible in a 2-3 hour timespan. Leverage git to demonstrate your work progression, and document the features you completed in the README.
- **Development practices questions:** Take some time within the alloted 2-3 hour time frame to share some high level thoughts on Dev Ops and modern development practices.
- **(Optional)** Add a new file or section to the existing README explaining thought process and general sentiment about the assessment. We are always looking for feedback!

## Overview

**Project Goal:**
Build a simple, full-stack application that enables users to explore the given baseball player and pitch data.

The application should enable a user to answer questions including but not limited to:

- What pitches did 'x' player throw or see?
- How many pitches did 'x' player throw or see?
- What pitches were thrown at 95 mph or greater?
- What players were on 'x' team?

The project leverages the following technology:
- **Backend**: Flask 
- **Frontend**: React.js (Typescript preferred, but Javascript is fine).
- **Database**: SQLite

**You are not expected to build a production-ready app or spend more than 2–3 hours** on this assessment.
Focus on demonstrating the quality of your work:

- Code readability and structure
- Abstraction/design
- Testing
- Documentation
- CI/CD intentions
- Maintainability

## Expectations

- **Commit Practices:**
  Please leverage Git as you work. Push **small, self-contained commits** as you make progress. We will be reviewing your commit history and looking for logical, incremental changes.

  > Tip: Work in focused increments and commit often—avoid uploading your entire solution all at once.

- **Time Management:**
  The project should take **no more than 2–3 hours**. It's OK if not every feature is completely finished—work to demonstrate your approach and reasoning.

## Submission Instructions

1. Fork this template and work in your own repo.
2. Organize your code so it demonstrates real-world practices (modular structure, clear documentation, etc).
3. Fill out the `QUESTIONS.md` file with your responses.
4. Push your work as **small, self-contained commits** so we can review your commit history.
5. Share a link to your forked repository as your submission.

We look forward to seeing how you approach this. Feel free to annotate your work with comments, trade-offs, or notes about what you’d improve with more time.
If you have questions, you may include them in an additional document or section in the README.

Good luck!
